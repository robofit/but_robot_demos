 * captured audio data as Data objects. </p> <p/> This Microphone will attempt to obtain an audio device with the format
 * specified in the configuration. If such a device with that format cannot be obtained, it will try to obtain a device
 * with an audio format that has a higher sample rate than the configured sample rate, while the other parameters of the
 * format (i.e., sample size, endianness, sign, and channel) remain the same. If, again, no such device can be obtained,
 * it flags an error, and a call <code>startRecording</code> returns false. </p>
